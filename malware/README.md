# Malware Research

This folder contains Zeid Data’s defensive malware research. Content here is focused on technical, reproducible analysis that supports detection engineering, incident response, and control validation across endpoint, network, identity, cloud, and data-plane telemetry.

Everything in this folder is intended to be safe for public release: sanitized artifacts, non-sensitive indicators, and defensive reproduction where appropriate.

## Organization

Malware research is organized by family:

research/malware/<family>/

Examples:
- research/malware/qilin/
- research/malware/lockbit/
- research/malware/black-basta/

Use the most common family name used by reputable sources. If the family name is disputed, pick one canonical folder name and document aliases in the family README.

## Standard family module layout

Minimum required:
- README.md
- references.md
- iocs/
- mitigations/

Recommended (as applicable):
- detections/
- workbooks/
- repro/
- samples/ (sanitized)
- pcaps/ (sanitized)
- figures/
- field-mapping.md
- assumptions.md

## Technical write-up standard (family README.md)

Each malware family README should be structured for operational use:

1) Overview
- family summary and primary objectives (encryption, extortion, persistence, access broker workflow)
- known aliases (if any)

2) Threat model
- target environment assumptions (enterprise vs SMB, Windows vs Linux, domain-joined vs cloud-native)
- attacker objectives (credential theft, lateral movement, data theft, encryption)

3) Kill chain and TTPs
- initial access vectors (as supported by references)
- execution and staging patterns
- privilege escalation and credential access patterns
- discovery and lateral movement
- exfiltration and encryption

4) Observables by telemetry layer
- Endpoint: process trees, modules, persistence, service/task creation, file system patterns
- Network: DNS/TLS/HTTP artifacts, egress shapes, C2 and exfil mechanics
- Identity/Cloud: non-interactive auth, suspicious app activity, bulk export patterns
- Data plane: anomalous queries, staging buckets, large outbound transfers

5) Detection guidance
- behavior-first detection logic
- correlation strategy (join keys, time windows, skew tolerance)
- tuning guidance and common false positives

6) Indicators (IOC strategy)
- IOC sets with provenance and time bounds
- emphasize behavioral discriminators over static indicators where possible

7) Mitigations and validation
- preventive controls (hardening, segmentation, least privilege)
- detective controls (logging requirements, alerting)
- verification steps (how to confirm controls are active and effective)

8) Response notes
- triage order (what to check first)
- containment options (identity lock, isolate hosts, block egress)
- evidence capture guidance (what to preserve)

9) Limitations
- telemetry gaps and blind spots
- expected evasion strategies
- where indicators may be unreliable

10) References
- link to references.md

## IOC standards

Indicators must live under `iocs/` and include provenance.

Recommended IOC files:
- iocs/domains.csv
- iocs/ips.csv
- iocs/hashes.csv
- iocs/urls.csv

Required columns:
- indicator
- type (domain|ip|sha256|url|registry|user-agent|cert)
- first_seen
- last_seen
- source
- confidence (low|medium|high)
- context
- tags

Do not commit customer identifiers, internal domains, or private infrastructure data. Use public-attributed infrastructure only, and document the source.

## Evidence and safety requirements

This folder is defensive and responsible:
- sanitize all artifacts (no secrets, no usernames/emails/tenant IDs)
- avoid publishing weaponized exploit automation
- reproduction harnesses must be defensive-oriented (validation and telemetry testing)
- document redactions and limitations clearly

## Contributing checklist

Before adding a new malware family or updating an existing one:
- [ ] correct path: research/malware/<family>/
- [ ] README.md follows the technical structure
- [ ] references.md includes primary sources
- [ ] iocs/ present with required columns and provenance
- [ ] mitigations include verification steps
- [ ] detections declare telemetry prerequisites and tuning notes
- [ ] artifacts are sanitized and safe for public release
