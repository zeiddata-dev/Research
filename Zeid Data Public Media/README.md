## 1. Purpose and Scope

This GitHub repository (“Repository”) is maintained by Zeid Data (“Zeid Data,” “we,” “our”) as a **centralized distribution library** for Zeid Data media and related collateral, including but not limited to:

- Brand assets (logos, banners, icons, templates)
- Marketing collateral (social graphics, product sheets, one-pagers)
- Documentation visuals (diagrams, screenshots, UI assets)
- Public research media (illustrations, charts, presentation assets)
- Supporting files intended for public sharing (e.g., image packs, design exports)

This Repository is intended to provide a **single authoritative source** for Zeid Data media that may be used, referenced, embedded, mirrored, redistributed, or otherwise incorporated into downstream materials in accordance with the applicable license(s).

## 2. Licensing and Permitted Use

All content in this Repository is published under an **open license** to facilitate lawful reuse and distribution by the public, partners, customers, and the broader community.

Where a specific asset, folder, or file includes an alternate license header, attribution requirement, or usage restriction, **that notice controls** for that asset. Users are responsible for reviewing and complying with any such notices.

## 3. Central Repository and Authoritative Source

Zeid Data uses this Repository as the **central source of truth** for public-facing media. Assets may be updated over time to improve quality, correct errors, or reflect current branding and product messaging.

Where feasible, Zeid Data will preserve stable naming and paths. However, Zeid Data reserves the right to reorganize, replace, or remove assets as needed. For production dependencies (e.g., embedding images in documentation), pin to a specific commit or release tag when stability is required.

## 4. Trademarks and Brand Identification

Open licensing for media does **not** grant rights to use Zeid Data trademarks (including names, logos, and product marks) in a manner that implies endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship where none exists.

“Zeid Data” and associated marks are trademarks or trade dress of Zeid Data and may be subject to trademark rights. Any use of Zeid Data marks must be truthful, non-misleading, and consistent with applicable law and any published brand guidelines.
