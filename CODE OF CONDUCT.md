## Our Pledge
Zeid Data is committed to providing a welcoming, professional, and harassment-free environment for everyone who participates in our projects and communities—regardless of experience level, identity, or background.

We value collaboration, transparency, and security-minded craftsmanship.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate in language and actions
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback with professionalism
- Assuming good intent and asking clarifying questions
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and its users
- Respecting privacy, confidentiality, and security boundaries
- Reporting security issues responsibly (see **Security** section)

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or personal attacks
- Threats, doxxing, stalking, or sharing private information without consent
- Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, deliberate disruption, or repeated bad-faith participation
- Encouraging unsafe, illegal, or unethical activity
- Sharing malware, exploit code, credentials, or instructions intended for wrongdoing

## Security & Responsible Disclosure
Because Zeid Data projects may touch security, privacy, and compliance topics:

- **Do not** post secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords), private customer data, or sensitive infrastructure details in issues, pull requests, or discussions.
- If you discover a vulnerability or security concern, **do not disclose it publicly**. Instead, use a private reporting path.

**Preferred reporting method:**
- Email: **security@zeiddata.com** (or your organization’s designated security contact)

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue and affected components
- Steps to reproduce (as safely as possible)
- Impact assessment and any supporting logs/screenshots (redacted)

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a responsible resolution timeline.

## Scope: Where This Applies
This Code of Conduct applies to:
- Repositories maintained by Zeid Data
- Issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
- Community spaces operated by Zeid Data (e.g., chat, forums) when associated with the project
- Project-related events or meetings (virtual or in-person)

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate action when behavior does not meet this Code of Conduct.

Enforcement actions may include:
- Warning or request for change
- Temporary restrictions or removal from discussions
- Reverting or rejecting contributions
- Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces

Maintainers will aim to enforce standards fairly and consistently, prioritizing community safety and project integrity.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Report it privately to: **conduct@zeiddata.com** (or the maintainers, if no mailbox exists)
- If the concern involves a security issue, use: **security@zeiddata.com**
- Include as much context as you can (links, screenshots, timestamps). Reports will be handled discreetly.

## Anti-Retaliation
Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith is not tolerated.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) and adapted for Zeid Data’s security-focused environment.
