# Minimum AI Use Policy (starter)

This policy exists because AI is powerful and humans are creative in the worst ways.

## Allowed
- Use approved AI systems for approved business tasks
- Use AI for drafting content with human review
- Use AI for code assistance with secure coding practices

## Not allowed
- Do not paste secrets, credentials, or private keys into AI systems
- Do not paste regulated data unless the system is approved for it
- Do not use unapproved personal AI accounts for company work
- Do not enable tools or retrieval sources without review

## Logging
Approved systems log usage events for security, quality, and compliance.
If you do not want it logged, do not do it on company systems.

## Exceptions
Exceptions require documented approval from Security and Privacy.

Yes, this is boring. That is the point.
