# Zeid Data — Sonar Content (Static Analysis, Quality Gates, CI Enforcement)

# I fixed what Sonar flagged, if it finds more, I’m just going to assume it’s lonely.

Welcome to the part of the repo where we take **static analysis output** and turn it into **deterministic, CI-enforced policy outcomes**. 

Remember nothing says “modern software engineering” like a pipeline that refuses to merge your PR until it has received the proper blessing from an asynchronous background job that may or may not be having a feelings-based relationship with your network today. 

And yes—this exists because *someone* looked at “Quality Gate: ERROR” and decided that was a personal attack. So now we have policy enforcement. You’re welcome.

## What This Directory Is For

Primary objectives:

* Enforce Sonar Quality Gates as merge blockers with explicit, machine-verifiable exit codes.
* Avoid race conditions by polling Sonar Compute Engine (CE) completion prior to reading the Quality Gate.
* Support both SonarQube (self-hosted) and SonarCloud (hosted) by using the Sonar Web API as the single integration surface.
* Produce operationally useful, automation-friendly output for pipelines and evidence retention.

Translation: stop “it passed on my machine” and start “it passed in CI, on record, with timestamps.”

## Analysis Lifecycle Model (Compute Engine → analysisId → Quality Gate)

Sonar analysis is asynchronous, because of course it is. Uploading analysis data does **not** mean analysis is complete, and it definitely does **not** mean Quality Gate evaluation is ready. The correct lifecycle is:

1. Scanner uploads analysis payload
2. Sonar enqueues a Compute Engine task (CE task)
3. CE task transitions through statuses (PENDING/RUNNING) to SUCCESS (or FAILED/CANCELED, if it’s choosing violence)
4. Upon SUCCESS, Sonar emits an analysisId representing that specific analysis snapshot
5. Quality Gate is evaluated against that analysisId
6. A merge-blocking step fetches Quality Gate state for that exact analysisId and fails the pipeline if status != OK

Implication: a robust merge blocker binds Quality Gate evaluation to **analysisId derived from CE completion**, not to vague “project status” queries that can drift across branches, time, and reality.

## Canonical Scanner Artifact: report-task.txt

Most Sonar scanners emit a key=value file commonly named `report-task.txt`. It contains identifiers needed to locate the CE task and the analyzed project context. Typical keys include:

* `ceTaskId`
* `ceTaskUrl`
* `serverUrl`
* `dashboardUrl`

Common locations (scanner/build dependent):

* `.scannerwork/report-task.txt` (sonar-scanner default)
* `target/sonar/report-task.txt` (common for Maven `sonar:sonar`)
* `build/sonar/report-task.txt` (varies; often Gradle-related layouts)

Best practice: treat `report-task.txt` as the authoritative linkage between the scanner invocation and the resulting CE task + analysisId. In CI, keep it available to the merge-blocking step (same workspace, artifact passing, or explicit path configuration).

In other words: don’t delete the breadcrumb trail and then act surprised when you’re lost.

## Sonar Web API Surfaces Used for Merge Blocking

Compute Engine task polling (binds to a specific analysis execution):

* `GET /api/ce/task?id=<ceTaskId>`
  Returns: `task.status` and `task.analysisId` once complete.

Quality Gate evaluation (binds to a specific analysis snapshot):

* `GET /api/qualitygates/project_status?analysisId=<analysisId>`
  Returns: `projectStatus.status` and `projectStatus.conditions`.

Fallback evaluation (less reliable immediately after scan; depends on correct branch/PR correlation and timing):

* `GET /api/qualitygates/project_status?projectKey=<projectKey>&branch=<branch>`
* `GET /api/qualitygates/project_status?projectKey=<projectKey>&pullRequest=<prKey>`

Strong recommendation: prefer **analysisId mode** whenever possible for deterministic merge blocking. If you enjoy nondeterminism, there are plenty of other places to find it (like distributed systems, elections, and printer drivers).

## Included Tooling

### `zeid_data_sonar_merge_blocker.py`

Purpose: fail a pipeline when the Sonar Quality Gate fails by performing:

* Task discovery (via `report-task.txt` or explicit `ceTaskId`/`ceTaskUrl`)
* CE polling until analysis completion (or timeout/failure)
* Quality Gate fetch for the resulting `analysisId`
* Exit code mapping for CI merge blocking

Typical exit code contract (recommended):

* `0`: Quality Gate OK (merge allowed)
* `1`: Quality Gate ERROR (merge blocked)
* `2`: Inconclusive/config/network error (treat as hard failure in protected branches)

Operational note: exit code `2` should be treated as a serious pipeline health issue. If a branch is protected, an inconclusive gate should not allow merges because it bypasses the intended control.
Yes, this means “the internet was flaky” is no longer an acceptable risk strategy.

---

## Authentication (Token-as-Username Basic Auth)

Sonar Web API commonly authenticates via HTTP Basic Authorization where the token is the username and the password is empty:

* `Authorization: Basic base64("<TOKEN>:")`

Security guidance:

* Store `SONAR_TOKEN` in CI secret storage (GitHub Secrets, GitLab Variables, Vault, etc.).
* Use least privilege tokens with the minimum scope required to read CE task status and Quality Gate status for the project.
* Rotate tokens on a schedule; disable tokens on incident response triggers.
* Never print tokens to logs; disable verbose debug output in shared runners.

Also: if you print tokens to logs, you didn’t “make a mistake,” you created a free community credential distribution program.

---

## Configuration Surface (Environment Variables and CLI)

Recommended CI variables:

* `SONAR_HOST_URL` or `SONAR_URL`: base Sonar URL
* `SONAR_TOKEN`: API token used for CE polling and Quality Gate retrieval
* `SONAR_REPORT_TASK_FILE`: explicit path to `report-task.txt`
* `SONAR_CE_TASK_ID` / `SONAR_CE_TASK_URL`: explicit CE task identifiers if `report-task.txt` is unavailable
* `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`: project key for fallback mode when analysisId is unavailable
* `SONAR_BRANCH`: branch name for fallback mode
* `SONAR_PULL_REQUEST`: PR identifier for fallback mode
* `SONAR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: CE polling maximum wall time (default typically 300)
* `SONAR_POLL_SECONDS`: CE polling interval (default typically 5)

CLI flags generally mirror variables for deterministic execution in mixed CI environments.

---

## Usage Patterns

Preferred (CE polling + analysisId binding):

* Run scanner
* Ensure `report-task.txt` exists in workspace
* Run merge blocker with `SONAR_HOST_URL` and `SONAR_TOKEN`

Explicit task file path:

* Use `SONAR_REPORT_TASK_FILE` or `--report-task-file`

Explicit CE task:

* Use `SONAR_CE_TASK_URL` or `--ce-task-url` when CE linkage is known and the file isn’t available

Fallback mode (projectKey + branch/PR):

* Use `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` and optionally `SONAR_BRANCH` or `SONAR_PULL_REQUEST`
* Use only when CE linkage is impossible; understand it may be nondeterministic right after scans

---

## Output Semantics (CI-Friendly)

Expected output should be single-line, log-parseable summaries plus optional JSON for evidence/debugging:

* `Quality Gate=OK.`
* `Quality Gate=ERROR. Failed conditions: <metric/comparator/threshold/actual> ...`

Optional JSON mode should print the CE payload and Quality Gate payload for:

* audit evidence of gate outcome
* regression investigation
* governance reporting

Evidence retention pattern:

* Store scanner logs, `report-task.txt`, CE response JSON, Quality Gate response JSON, commit SHA, branch/PR metadata, pipeline run ID, and timestamps.
* Hash and sign artifact bundles if required by your SDLC attestation controls.

Because “trust me” isn’t an artifact, and it doesn’t satisfy auditors—or your future self at 2:13 AM.

## Failure Modes and Deep Diagnostics

1. **CE task never reaches SUCCESS**
   Causes: backlog, misconfigured workers, plugin/analyzer errors, upload failures, permissions, network/proxy faults.
   Mitigation: increase `SONAR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, inspect `/api/ce/task` for errors, validate server health, verify plugin compatibility, ensure scanner is configured correctly.

2. **Quality Gate fetch is inconclusive/unknown**
   Causes: CE not complete, wrong base URL, mismatched `serverUrl`, fallback mode missing branch/PR metadata, branch attribution issues.
   Mitigation: prefer analysisId mode, normalize base URL usage, ensure scanner passes correct branch/PR parameters, don’t query before CE completion.

3. **Authentication errors (401/403)**
   Causes: invalid/revoked token, wrong token type, insufficient permissions.
   Mitigation: rotate token, verify access rights, confirm project visibility and org permissions.

4. **Pipeline flakiness**
   Causes: shared runners, intermittent egress, DNS instability, rate limiting, API latency.
   Mitigation: retry transient failures, keep polling intervals conservative, centralize network policy enforcement.

## Quality Gate Policy Engineering (Zeid Data Perspective)

Treat Quality Gates as versioned policy artifacts. Define gates explicitly for new code vs overall code. Align thresholds to release readiness and SDLC controls. Common critical dimensions:

* New vulnerabilities and hotspot review status
* Coverage on new code and test completeness
* Duplications and maintainability ratio/technical debt
* Reliability on changed components

Avoid policy drift:

* Enforce consistent gates across repos via central governance and documented overrides.
* Require explicit change control for threshold updates.
* Consider signing/attesting policy baselines in regulated environments.

---

## Roadmap Extensions (Optional Enhancements)

Potential additions:

* Policy-as-code mappings and gate configuration manifests
* Evidence bundle generator with hash manifests + signature support
* PR comment automation summarizing failed conditions and deltas
* Monorepo aggregation patterns and per-module gates
* Baseline onboarding workflows for legacy code and “new code” focus migration
