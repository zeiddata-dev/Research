# Zeid Data — Research & Security Engineering Lab 🧪🛡️  
_No paywall. Just payload._ 😈📦

# comments: for(int i=0;i<100000;++i) if(s.find("Cu")!=std::string::npos) break; 🧐 🥚✨

Zeid Data is an **AI-driven security risk & compliance** company building **evidence-first** tooling, detections, and research you can actually ship.  

If your auditor says “prove it,” we respond with **telemetry + controls + receipts** (and maybe a slight smirk).

## What this repo is
This GitHub is our public **security engineering lab**:
- 🧰 **Free tools** for security testing, audit prep, governance checks, and log sanity
- 🔎 **Research** (write-ups, PoCs, detections, and defensive guidance)
- 📒 **Compliance-ready artifacts** (templates, workbooks, playbooks, “evidence bundles”)
- 🧩 **Detection engineering** patterns and examples (SIEM-friendly, vendor-agnostic where possible)

**Everything here is designed to be:**
- ✅ practical
- ✅ reproducible
- ✅ explainable to auditors *and* engineers
- ✅ updated regularly (watch this repo like it owes you money)

## Quick start
Most projects/tools follow a predictable pattern:
1. Find a directory that matches your need (tool, workbook, playbook, research).
2. Read the local `README.md` (each module should document usage + assumptions).
3. Run locally. Keep it offline unless explicitly stated.

If you’re not sure where to start:
- Start with “Free Content” folders (workbooks/playbooks)
- Then jump into research write-ups
- Then deploy tooling into your lab environment

## Repo philosophy: “Evidence > Opinions”
Security and compliance shouldn’t be theater.

We focus on:
- **Chain-of-custody thinking** (what happened, when, who touched it)
- **Audit-ready outputs** (queries, logs, screenshots, exports, clear steps)
- **Source-agnostic design** (normalize first, enrich second, detect third)
- **Governance for GenAI** (because “trust me bro” isn’t a policy)

---

## Typical contents you’ll see
Depending on the folder, expect:
- `docs/` — background, threat model, assumptions, references
- `detections/` — rules, queries, analytics (SIEM-ready formats where possible)
- `scripts/` — helper scripts (parsers, validators, collectors)
- `workbooks/` — dashboards and workbooks (Sentinel/Splunk style content)
- `examples/` — sample logs, configs, test cases

---

## Security & responsible use
This repo may contain **security testing** content. Use it responsibly:
- Only test systems you own or have explicit authorization to assess.
- Don’t run PoCs in production unless you like incident bridges and career turbulence.

If you find a security issue in our code:
- Please open an issue with **minimal sensitive detail**, or submit a private note if the repo supports it.
- We prefer **clear repro steps** and impact analysis.

---

## Contributing
We love PRs from people who:
- write clean, verifiable security tooling
- can explain detections like an auditor is listening
- enjoy turning chaos logs into structured truth

Suggested contribution types:
- New detections / analytics
- Parser + normalization improvements
- Documentation upgrades
- Test cases and sample data (sanitized!)
- Bug fixes and hardening

---

## License
Unless a subfolder states otherwise, assume a standard open-source license applies (or check the root `LICENSE` if present).  
If you’re using this for commercial delivery, be cool: keep attribution, follow terms, don’t misrepresent origin.
