# Zeid Data — Splunk Content Repository

This repository is a centralized home for **Splunk-focused security, detection engineering, and compliance analytics content** built and maintained by Zeid Data.

The goal: ship practical, audit-friendly artifacts you can deploy, review, and iterate on—without mystery meat.

## What you’ll find here

Content is organized as reusable building blocks for Splunk environments, including (depending on the folder):

- **Searches & detections** (saved searches, correlation searches, notable-event patterns)
- **Dashboards & visualizations** (SOC views, compliance views, evidence views)
- **Field extractions & normalization** (regex, calculated fields, CIM-aligned mappings)
- **Knowledge objects** (macros, event types, tags, lookups, workflow actions)
- **Configs** (`props.conf`, `transforms.conf`, `inputs.conf`, etc.)
- **Apps / add-ons (TAs)** (packaged content when appropriate)
- **Documentation** (deployment notes, assumptions, validation steps)

> If it didn’t generate evidence, it didn’t happen. This repo tries to make that statement true.
