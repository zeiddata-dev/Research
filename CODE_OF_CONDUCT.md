# Code of Conduct (Zeid Data)

## Our Pledge

Zeid Data is committed to a welcoming, professional, harassment free environment for everyone who shows up to build, review, argue about commas, or ship code into production. That includes all experience levels, identities, and backgrounds.

We value collaboration, transparency, and security minded craftsmanship.
Translation: be decent, be useful, don’t be a liability.

## Our Standards

Stuff that helps keep the place functional (and not a social media dumpster fire):

* Be respectful and considerate in language and actions
* Give and take feedback like an adult, not a keyboard gladiator
* Assume good intent, ask clarifying questions, and stop speed running outrage
* Prioritize what’s best for the project and its users, not your ego
* Respect privacy, confidentiality, and security boundaries
* Report security issues responsibly (see **Security** section) because “I posted the vuln in an issue for visibility” is not a personality

Stuff that will get you shown the door (politely, then permanently):

* Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, personal attacks
* Threats, doxxing, stalking, or sharing private info without consent
* Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention
* Trolling, deliberate disruption, or repeated bad faith participation
* Encouraging unsafe, illegal, or unethical activity
* Sharing malware, exploit code, creds, or instructions meant for wrongdoing
  (If your contribution is “here’s how to break in,” congrats, you invented **crime**)

## Security & Responsible Disclosure

Because Zeid Data projects sometimes touch security, privacy, and compliance topics, we need to say the obvious out loud:

* **Do not** post secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords), private customer data, or sensitive infra details in issues, PRs, or discussions.
  Yes, even “just for testing.” Especially “just for testing.”
* If you discover a vulnerability or security concern, **do not disclose it publicly**.
  Public disclosure without coordination is not bravery. It’s chaos cosplay.

**Preferred reporting method:**

* Email: **[security@zeiddata.com](mailto:security@zeiddata.com)** (or your organization’s designated security contact)

Please include:

* A clear description of the issue and affected components
* Steps to reproduce (as safely as possible)
* Impact assessment and any supporting logs/screenshots (redacted, unless you enjoy handing out data leaks)

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a responsible resolution timeline.
No, that doesn’t mean “drop it on Twitter and tag us.”

## Scope: Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* Repositories maintained by Zeid Data
* Issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
* Community spaces operated by Zeid Data (chat, forums, etc.) when associated with the project
* Project related events or meetings (virtual or in person)
  Basically: if it’s connected to the project, don’t act feral.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate action when behavior doesn’t meet this Code of Conduct.

Possible enforcement actions include:

* Warning or request for change (the “hey, stop” phase)
* Temporary restrictions or removal from discussions (time out corner)
* Reverting or rejecting contributions (your PR is not a constitutional right)
* Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces (the “unsubscribe from our oxygen” option)

Maintainers will aim to enforce standards fairly and consistently, prioritizing community safety and project integrity.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

* Report it privately to: **[conduct@zeiddata.com](mailto:conduct@zeiddata.com)** (or the maintainers, if no mailbox exists)
* If the concern involves a security issue, use: **[security@zeiddata.com](mailto:security@zeiddata.com)**
* Include as much context as you can (links, screenshots, timestamps). Reports will be handled discreetly.
  We want receipts, not vibes.

## Anti Retaliation

Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith is not tolerated.
If you punish someone for reporting, you’re volunteering for the ban list.

## Attribution

Inspired by Contributor Covenant (v2.1) and adapted for Zeid Data’s security focused environment.
Yes, we read the grown up template and then added the security parts people love to ignore.
